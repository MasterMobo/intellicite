so the WinkNLP tutorial thing only works on a specific platform that is Observable

and PyTorch doesn't have a comprehensive guide on how to detect relevant text, it applies to a lot of other
NLP libraries

so in the end I come up with a trick that is detect lines that contains at least some words in user input
it only uses NLTK and for now it's very lightweight, only contains a few lines of code
so next stop I will make it read text from a pdf file instead of a given paragraph and read keywords from
user input (Scanner.in)
